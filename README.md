# Database Course (PostgreSQL)

This repository contains completed laboratory works for a university Database course. Each `LabN.txt` file is a real console transcript from `psql` (including prompts and output) showing exact commands and what Postgres returned.

* **Environment used:** PostgreSQL **14.18 → 14.19** on Ubuntu 22.04, `psql` CLI.
